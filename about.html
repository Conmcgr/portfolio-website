            <p> Hi! My name is Connor McGraw, I'm from the Bay Area and I'm currently pursuing a bachelors and masters degree in computer science from the University of Chicago. I'm excited about all aspects of computer science and software development but I have a keen interest in AI/ML and leverging these new technologies to make a positive impact in the world! I've gained experience in software development, data analytics, and machine learning through various internships and projects. </p>
            <p>I have a strong foundation in various programming languages and tools, and I enjoy tackling complex problems and finding innovative solutions. In my free time, I love playing basketball, lifting weights, watching sports, and eating great food! </p>
